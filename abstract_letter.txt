While the traditional AMCE-based approach to analyzing conjoint experiments is still relevant to political scientists, the approach usually ignores individual characteristics of survey respondents. Information such as race, income and party identification is usually ignored in traditional conjoint analyses. We consider this a limitation. In this letter we fill this gap by introducing machine learning methods to analyzing conjoint datasets. Using support vector machine methods we are able to focus on individual preferences---elicited via conjoint designs---and political attitudes (particularly, the willingness to sell the vote). This letter seeks to ``bring survey respondents back in'' by analyzing their stated preferences within the traditional conjoint framework. We motivate the applied portion of this letter exploiting a novel conjoint dataset about democracy and clientelism in the United States.
