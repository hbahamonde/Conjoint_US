Democracy has traditionally been theorized as a multidimensional concept \parencite{Dahl1971}. Yet, the quantitative study of clientelism---as a democratic failure---has been mostly studied from a unidimensional perspective. We argue that to better understand clientelism, quantitative studies should situate the phenomena within the multidimensionality of democracy to understand which specific subdimension should fail to explain vote selling. By leveraging a conjoint experiment on hypothetical vote selling in the United States---a traditionally considered consolidated democracy---this paper makes both methodological and substantive contributions to the literature. Using machine learning techniques, the paper identifies that among the five conjoint attributes considered in this study, the one related to the co-dependence of the Presidency on Congress is the only one that explains individual levels of vote selling. These findings are particularly relevant to the study of American democracy given the fact that the data were collected during the campaign period where Donald Trump was elected.
