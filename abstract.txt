This paper explains that democracy has been theorized as a multidimensional concept. Yet, the quantitative study of clientelism---as a democracy failure---has been studied almost exclusively from a unidimensional perspective. For instance, list experiments usually study one aspect at a time by manipulating a word, a sentence or a framing. We argue that to better understand clientelism quantitative studies should situate the phenomena within the multidimensionality of democracy. This paper makes both methodological and substantive contributions to the literature by leveraging a conjoint experiment on hypothetical vote selling in a consolidated democracy. Conjoint designs ask respondents to choose from hypothetical profiles that combine multiple attributes. To study which democratic dimension(s) should fail to produce clientelism, we presented subjects two hypothetical candidates that supported (or not) every policy (attribute). Using machine learning techniques, we identify which dimensions should ``fail'' to produce likely vote-sellers.
